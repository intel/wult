.TP
\f[B]\-h\f[R]
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\f[B]\-q\f[R]
Be quiet.
.TP
\f[B]\-d\f[R]
Print debugging information.
.TP
\f[B]\-o\f[R] \f[I]OUTDIR\f[R], \f[B]\-\-outdir\f[R] \f[I]OUTDIR\f[R]
Path to the directory to store the report at.
By default the report is stored in the \[aq]ndl\-report\-<reportid>\[aq]
sub\-directory of the test result directory.
If there are multiple test results, the report is stored in the current
directory.
The \[aq]<reportid>\[aq] is report ID of ndl test result.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-exclude\f[R] \f[I]EXCLUDE\f[R]
Datapoints to exclude: remove all the datapoints satisfying the
expression \[aq]EXCLUDE\[aq].
Here is an example of an expression: \[aq](WakeLatency < 10000) | (PC6%
< 1)\[aq].
This filter expression will remove all datapoints with
\[aq]WakeLatency\[aq] smaller than 10000 nanoseconds or package C6
residency smaller than 1%.
The detailed expression syntax can be found in the documentation for the
\[aq]eval()\[aq] function of Python \[aq]pandas\[aq] module.
You can use metrics in the expression, or the special word
\[aq]index\[aq] for the row number (0\-based index) of a datapoint in
the results.
For example, expression \[aq]index >= 10\[aq] will get rid of all
datapoints except for the first 10 ones.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-include\f[R] \f[I]INCLUDE\f[R]
Datapoints to include: remove all datapoints except for those satisfying
the expression \[aq]INCLUDE\[aq].
In other words, this option is the inverse of \[aq]\-\-exclude\[aq].
This means, \[aq]\-\-include expr\[aq] is the same as \[aq]\-\-exclude
\[dq]not (expr)\[dq]\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]\-\-even\-up\-dp\-count\f[R]
Even up datapoints count before generating the report.
This option is useful when generating a report for many test results (a
diff).
If the test results contain different count of datapoints (rows count in
the CSV file), the resulting histograms may look a little bit
misleading.
This option evens up datapoints count in the test results.
It just finds the test result with the minimum count of datapoints and
ignores the extra datapoints in the other test results.
.TP
\f[B]\-x\f[R] \f[I]XAXES\f[R], \f[B]\-\-xaxes\f[R] \f[I]XAXES\f[R]
A comma\-separated list of metrics (or python style regular expressions
matching the names) to use on X\-axes of the scatter plot(s), default is
\[aq]LDist\[aq].
Use \[aq]\-\-list\-metrics\[aq] to get the list of the available
metrics.
Use value \[aq]none\[aq] to disable scatter plots.
.TP
\f[B]\-y\f[R] \f[I]YAXES\f[R], \f[B]\-\-yaxes\f[R] \f[I]YAXES\f[R]
A comma\-separated list of metrics (or python style regular expressions
matching the names) to use on the Y\-axes for the scatter plot(s).
If multiple metrics are specified for the X\- or Y\-axes, then the
report will include multiple scatter plots for all the X\- and Y\-axes
combinations.
The default is \[aq]RTD\[aq].
Use \[aq]\-\-list\-metrics\[aq] to get the list of the available
metrics.
Use value \[aq]none\[aq] to disable scatter plots.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-hist\f[R] \f[I]HIST\f[R]
A comma\-separated list of metrics (or python style regular expressions
matching the names) to add a histogram for, default is \[aq]RTD\[aq].
Use \[aq]\-\-list\-metrics\[aq] to get the list of the available
metrics.
Use value \[aq]none\[aq] to disable histograms.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-chist\f[R] \f[I]CHIST\f[R]
A comma\-separated list of metrics (or python style regular expressions
matching the names) to add a cumulative distribution for, default is
\[aq]RTD\[aq].
Use \[aq]\-\-list\-metrics\[aq] to get the list of the available
metrics.
Use value \[aq]none\[aq] to disable cumulative histograms.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-reportids\f[R] \f[I]REPORTIDS\f[R]
Every input raw result comes with a report ID.
This report ID is basically a short name for the test result, and it
used in the HTML report to refer to the test result.
However, sometimes it is helpful to temporarily override the report IDs
just for the HTML report, and this is what the \[aq]\-\-reportids\[aq]
option does.
Please, specify a comma\-separated list of report IDs for every input
raw test result.
The first report ID will be used for the first raw rest result, the
second report ID will be used for the second raw test result, and so on.
Please, refer to the \[aq]\-\-reportid\[aq] option description in the
\[aq]start\[aq] command for more information about the report ID.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-report\-descr\f[R] \f[I]REPORT_DESCR\f[R]
The report description \- any text describing this report as whole, or
path to a file containing the overall report description.
For example, if the report compares platform A and platform B, the
description could be something like
.TP
\f[B]\-\-copy\-raw\f[R]
Copy raw test results to the output directory (unless the output
direcory is already part of the raw result sub\-directory).
.TP
\f[B]\-\-list\-metrics\f[R]
Print the list of the available metrics and exit.
