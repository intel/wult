.PP
Filter datapoints out of a test result by removing CSV rows and metrics
according to specified criteria.
The criteria is specified using the row and metric filter and selector
options (\[aq]\-\-include\[aq], \[aq]\-\-exclude\-metrics\[aq], etc).
The options may be specified multiple times.
.TP
\f[B]respath\f[R]
The wult test result path to filter.
.SS OPTIONS \f[I]\[aq]wult\f[R] filter\[aq]
.TP
\f[B]\-h\f[R]
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\f[B]\-q\f[R]
Be quiet.
.TP
\f[B]\-d\f[R]
Print debugging information.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-exclude\f[R] \f[I]EXCLUDE\f[R]
Datapoints to exclude: remove all the datapoints satisfying the
expression \[aq]EXCLUDE\[aq].
Here is an example of an expression: \[aq](WakeLatency < 10000) | (PC6%
< 1)\[aq].
This filter expression will remove all datapoints with
\[aq]WakeLatency\[aq] smaller than 10000 nanoseconds or package C6
residency smaller than 1%.
The detailed expression syntax can be found in the documentation for the
\[aq]eval()\[aq] function of Python \[aq]pandas\[aq] module.
You can use metrics in the expression, or the special word
\[aq]index\[aq] for the row number (0\-based index) of a datapoint in
the results.
For example, expression \[aq]index >= 10\[aq] will get rid of all
datapoints except for the first 10 ones.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-include\f[R] \f[I]INCLUDE\f[R]
Datapoints to include: remove all datapoints except for those satisfying
the expression \[aq]INCLUDE\[aq].
In other words, this option is the inverse of \[aq]\-\-exclude\[aq].
This means, \[aq]\-\-include expr\[aq] is the same as \[aq]\-\-exclude
\[dq]not (expr)\[dq]\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]\-\-exclude\-metrics\f[R] \f[I]MEXCLUDE\f[R]
The metrics to exclude.
Expects a comma\-separated list of the metrics or python style regular
expressions matching the names.
For example, the expression \[aq]SilentTime,WarmupDelay,.*Cyc\[aq],
would remove metrics \[aq]SilentTime\[aq], \[aq]WarmupDelay\[aq] and all
metrics with \[aq]Cyc\[aq] in their name.
Use \[aq]\-\-list\-metrics\[aq] to get the list of the available
metrics.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-include\-metrics\f[R] \f[I]MINCLUDE\f[R]
The metrics to include: remove all metrics except for those specified by
this option.
The syntax is the same as for \[aq]\-\-exclude\-metrics\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]\-\-human\-readable\f[R]
By default the result \[aq]filter\[aq] command print the result as a CSV
file to the standard output.
This option can be used to dump the result in a more human\-readable
form.
.TP
\f[B]\-o\f[R] \f[I]OUTDIR\f[R], \f[B]\-\-outdir\f[R] \f[I]OUTDIR\f[R]
By default the resulting CSV lines are printed to the standard output.
But this option can be used to specify the output directly to store the
result at.
This will create a filtered version of the input test result.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-list\-metrics\f[R]
Print the list of the available metrics and exit.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-reportid\f[R] \f[I]REPORTID\f[R]
Report ID of the filtered version of the result (can only be used with
\[aq]\-\-outdir\[aq]).
