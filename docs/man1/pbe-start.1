.TP
\f[B]-h\f[R]
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\f[B]-q\f[R]
Be quiet.
.TP
\f[B]-d\f[R]
Print debugging information.
.TP
\f[B]-H\f[R] \f[I]HOSTNAME\f[R], \f[B]--host\f[R] \f[I]HOSTNAME\f[R]
Name of the host to run the command on.
.TP
\f[B]-U\f[R] \f[I]USERNAME\f[R], \f[B]--username\f[R] \f[I]USERNAME\f[R]
Name of the user to use for logging into the remote host over SSH.
The default user name is \[aq]root\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]-K\f[R] \f[I]PRIVKEY\f[R], \f[B]--priv-key\f[R] \f[I]PRIVKEY\f[R]
Path to the private SSH key that should be used for logging into the
remote host.
By default the key is automatically found from standard paths like
\[aq]\[ti]/.ssh\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]-T\f[R] \f[I]TIMEOUT\f[R], \f[B]--timeout\f[R] \f[I]TIMEOUT\f[R]
SSH connect timeout in seconds, default is 8.
.TP
\f[B]-w\f[R] \f[I]WAKEPERIOD\f[R], \f[B]--wakeperiod\f[R] \f[I]WAKEPERIOD\f[R]
The wake period range to go through.
The default range is [10us,10ms], but you can override it with this
option by specifying a comma- separated range.
The default unit is microseconds, but you can use the following
specifiers as well: ms - milliseconds, us -microseconds, ns -
nanoseconds.
For example, \[aq]--wakeperiod 20us,1ms\[aq] would be a [20,1000]
microseconds range.
.TP
\f[B]-S\f[R] \f[I]WAKEPERIOD_STEP\f[R], \f[B]--wakeperiod-step\f[R] \f[I]WAKEPERIOD_STEP\f[R]
The wake period step.
By default it is 1%.
You can specify a percent value or an absolute time value.
In the latter case, you can use one of the following specifiers: ms -
milliseconds, us - microseconds, ns - nanoseconds.
For example, \[aq]--wakeperiod-step=1ms\[aq] means that wake period will
be incremented by 1 millisecond on every iteration.
If no unit was specified, microseconds are assumed.
.TP
\f[B]--span\f[R] \f[I]SPAN\f[R]
For how long a single wake period value should be measured.
By default, it is 1 minute.
Specify time value in minutes, or use one of the following specifiers: d
- days, h - hours, m - minutes, s -seconds.
.TP
\f[B]--warmup\f[R] \f[I]WARMUP\f[R]
When this tool starts measuring a new wake period value, first it lets
the system \[dq]warm up\[dq] for some amount of time, and starts
collecting the data (e.g., power) only after the warm up period.
This allows the system to get into the \[dq]steady state\[dq] (e.g.,
fans speed and CPU temperature stabilizes).
By default, the warm up period is 1 minute.
Specify a value in minutes, or use one of the following specifiers: d -
days, h - hours, m - minutes, s - seconds.
.TP
\f[B]-o\f[R] \f[I]OUTDIR\f[R], \f[B]--outdir\f[R] \f[I]OUTDIR\f[R]
Path to the directory to store the results at.
.TP
\f[B]--stats\f[R] \f[I]STATS\f[R]
Comma-separated list of statistics to collect.
The statistics are collected in parallel with power break-even data
collection.
They are stored in the the \[dq]stats\[dq] sub-directory of the output
directory.
By default, only \[aq]turbostat, sysinfo\[aq] statistics are collected.
Use \[aq]all\[aq] to collect all possible statistics.
Use \[aq]--stats=\[dq]\[dq]\[aq] or \[aq]--stats=\[dq]none\[dq]\[aq] to
disable statistics collection.
If you know exactly what statistics you need, specify the
comma-separated list of statistics to collect.
For example, use \[aq]turbostat,acpower\[aq] if you need only turbostat
and AC power meter statistics.
You can also specify the statistics you do not want to be collected by
pre-pending the \[aq]!\[aq] symbol.
For example, \[aq]all,!turbostat\[aq] would mean: collect all the
statistics supported by the SUT, except for \[aq]turbostat\[aq].
Use the \[aq]--list-stats\[aq] option to get more information about
available statistics.
.TP
\f[B]--stats-intervals\f[R] \f[I]STATS_INTERVALS\f[R]
The intervals for statistics.
Statistics collection is based on doing periodic snapshots of data.
For example, by default the \[aq]acpower\[aq] statistics collector reads
SUT power consumption for the last second every second, and
\[aq]turbostat\[aq] default interval is 5 seconds.
Use \[aq]acpower:5,turbostat:10\[aq] to increase the intervals to 5 and
10 seconds correspondingly.
Use the \[aq]--list-stats\[aq] to get the default interval values.
.TP
\f[B]--list-stats\f[R]
Print information about the statistics \[aq]pbe\[aq] can collect and
exit.
.TP
\f[B]--reportid\f[R] \f[I]REPORTID\f[R]
Any string which may serve as an identifier of this run.
By default report ID is the current date, prefixed with the remote host
name in case the \[aq]-H\[aq] option was used: [hostname-]YYYYMMDD.
For example, \[dq]20150323\[dq] is a report ID for a run made on March
23, 2015.
The allowed characters are: ACSII alphanumeric, \[aq]-\[aq],
\[aq].\[aq], \[aq],\[aq], \[aq]_\[aq], \[aq]\[ti]\[aq], and \[aq]:\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]--report\f[R]
Generate an HTML report for collected results (same as calling
\[aq]report\[aq] command with default arguments).
.TP
\f[B]--lead-cpu\f[R]
The lead CPU.
This is the CPU that will set timers and send interrupts to all other
CPUs to wake them when the timers expire.
The default is CPU 0.
