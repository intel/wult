usage: pbe deploy [\-h] [\-q] [\-d] [\-\-kernel\-src KSRC]

.PP
Compile and deploy pbe drivers to the SUT (System Under Test), which can
be can be either local or a remote host, depending on the \[aq]\-H\[aq]
option.
By default, everything is built on the SUT, but the
\[aq]\-\-local\-build\[aq] can be used for building on the local system.
The drivers are searched for in the following directories (and in the
following order) on the local host: ./drivers/idle,
$WULT_DATA_PATH/drivers/idle, $HOME/.local/share/wult/drivers/idle,
/usr/local/share/wult/drivers/idle, /usr/share/wult/drivers/idle.
.SH OPTIONS \f[I]\[aq]pbe\f[R] deploy\[aq]
.TP
\f[B]\-h\f[R]
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\f[B]\-q\f[R]
Be quiet.
.TP
\f[B]\-d\f[R]
Print debugging information.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-kernel\-src\f[R] \f[I]KSRC\f[R]
Path to the Linux kernel sources to build drivers against.
The default is \[aq]/lib/modules/$(uname \-r)/build\[aq] on the SUT.
If \[aq]\-\-local\-build\[aq] was used, then the path is considered to
be on the local system, rather than the SUT.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-drivers\-make\-opts\f[R]
Options and variables to pass to \[aq]make\[aq] when the drivers are
built.
For example, pass \[aq]CC=clang LLVM=1\[aq] to use clang and LLVM tools
for building the drivers (required when the kernel was build with
clang/LLVM).
.TP
\f[B]\-\-local\-build\f[R]
Build drivers locally, instead of building on HOSTNAME (the SUT).
.TP
\f[B]\-\-tmpdir\-path\f[R] \f[I]TMPDIR_PATH\f[R]
When \[aq]pbe\[aq] is deployed, a random temporary directory is used.
Use this option provide a custom path instead.
It will be used as a temporary directory on both local and remote hosts.
This option is meant for debugging purposes.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-keep\-tmpdir\f[R]
Do not remove the temporary directories created while deploying
\[aq]pbe\[aq].
This option is meant for debugging purposes.
.TP
\f[B]\-H\f[R] \f[I]HOSTNAME\f[R], \f[B]\-\-host\f[R] \f[I]HOSTNAME\f[R]
Name of the host to run the command on.
.TP
\f[B]\-U\f[R] \f[I]USERNAME\f[R], \f[B]\-\-username\f[R] \f[I]USERNAME\f[R]
Name of the user to use for logging into the remote host over SSH.
The default user name is \[aq]root\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]\-K\f[R] \f[I]PRIVKEY\f[R], \f[B]\-\-priv\-key\f[R] \f[I]PRIVKEY\f[R]
Path to the private SSH key that should be used for logging into the
remote host.
By default the key is automatically found from standard paths like
\[aq]\[ti]/.ssh\[aq].
.TP
\f[B]\-T\f[R] \f[I]TIMEOUT\f[R], \f[B]\-\-timeout\f[R] \f[I]TIMEOUT\f[R]
SSH connect timeout in seconds, default is 8.
