usage: ndl deploy [\-h] [\-q] [\-d] [\-\-kernel\-src KSRC] [\-\-local\-build] [\-\-tmpdir\-path TMPDIR_PATH] [\-\-keep\-tmpdir] [\-H HOSTNAME] [\-U USERNAME] [\-K PRIVKEY] [\-T TIMEOUT]

Compile and deploy ndl helpers and drivers to the SUT (System Under Test), which can be can be either local or a remote host, depending on the '\-H' option. By default, everything is built on the SUT, but the '\-\-local\-build' can be used for building on the local system. The drivers are searched for in the following directories (and in the following order) on the local host: ./drivers/idle, $WULT_DATA_PATH/drivers/idle, $HOME/.local/share/wult/drivers/idle, /usr/local/share/wult/drivers/idle, /usr/share/wult/drivers/idle. The ndl tool also depends on the following helpers: ndl\-helper. These helpers will be compiled on the SUT and deployed to the SUT. The sources of the helpers are searched for in the following paths (and in the following order) on the local host: ./helpers, $WULT_DATA_PATH/helpers, $HOME/.local/share/wult/helpers, /usr/local/share/wult/helpers, /usr/share/wult/helpers. By default, helpers are deployed to the path defined by the 'WULT_HELPERSPATH' environment variable. If the variable is not defined, helpers are deployed to '$HOME/.local/bin', where '$HOME' is the home directory of user 'USERNAME' on host 'HOST' (see '\-\-host' and '\-\-username' options).

SSH connect timeout in seconds, default is 8.

.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fI\,COUNT\/\fR, \fB\-\-datapoints\fR \fI\,COUNT\/\fR
How many datapoints should the test result include, default is 1000000. Note, unless the '\-\-start\-over' option is used, the pre\-existing datapoints are taken into account. For example, if the test result already has 6000 datapoints and
'\-c 10000' is used, the tool will collect 4000 datapoints and exit. Warning: collecting too many datapoints may result in a very large test result file, which will be difficult to process later, because that would require a lot of
memory.

.TP
\fB\-\-time\-limit\fR \fI\,LIMIT\/\fR
The measurement time limit, i.e., for how long the SUT should be measured. The default unit is minute, but you can use the following handy specifiers as well: d \- days, h \- hours, m \- minutes, s \- seconds. For example '1h25m' would be 1
hour and 25 minutes, or 10m5s would be 10 minutes and 5 seconds. Value '0' means "no time limit", and this is the default. If this option is used along with the '\-\-datapoints' option, then measurements will stop as when either the time
limit is reached, or the required amount of datapoints is collected.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR, \fB\-\-outdir\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR
Path to the directory to store the results at.

.TP
\fB\-\-reportid\fR \fI\,REPORTID\/\fR
Any string which may serve as an identifier of this run. By default report ID is the current date, prefixed with the remote host name in case the '\-H' option was used: [hostname\-]YYYYMMDD. For example, "20150323" is a report ID for a
run made on March 23, 2015. The allowed characters are: ACSII alphanumeric, '\-', '.', ',', '_', '~', and ':'.

.TP
\fB\-\-stats\fR \fI\,STATS\/\fR
Comma\-separated list of statistics to collect. The statistics are collected in parallel with measuring C\-state latency. They are stored in the the "stats" sub\-directory of the output directory. By default, only 'sysinfo' statistics are
collected. Use 'all' to collect all possible statistics. Use '\-\-stats=""' or \-\-stats='none' to disable statistics collection. If you know exactly what statistics you need, specify the comma\-separated list of statistics to collect. For
example, use 'turbostat,acpower' if you need only turbostat and AC power meter statistics. You can also specify the statistics you do not want to be collected by pre\-pending the '!' symbol. For example, 'all,!turbostat' would mean:
collect all the statistics supported by the SUT, except for 'turbostat'. Use the '\-\-list\-stats' option to get more information about available statistics. By default, only 'sysinfo' statistics are collected.

.TP
\fB\-\-stats\-intervals\fR \fI\,STATS_INTERVALS\/\fR
The intervals for statistics. Statistics collection is based on doing periodic snapshots of data. For example, by default the 'acpower' statistics collector reads SUT power consumption for the last second every second, and 'turbostat'
default interval is 5 seconds. Use 'acpower:5,turbostat:10' to increase the intervals to 5 and 10 seconds correspondingly. Use the '\-\-list\-stats' to get the default interval values.

.TP
\fB\-\-list\-stats\fR
Print information about the statistics 'ndl' can collect and exit.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fI\,LDIST\/\fR, \fB\-\-ldist\fR \fI\,LDIST\/\fR
The launch distance in microseconds. This tool works by scheduling a delayed network packet, then sleeping and waiting for the packet to be sent. This step is referred to as a "measurement cycle" and it is usually repeated many times.
The launch distance defines how far in the future the delayed network packets are scheduled. By default this tool randomly selects launch distance in range of [5000, 50000] microseconds (same as '\-\-ldist 5000,50000'). Specify a comma\-
separated range or a single value if you want launch distance to be precisely that value all the time. The default unit is microseconds, but you can use the following specifiers as well: ms \- milliseconds, us \- microseconds, ns \-
nanoseconds. For example, '\-\-ldist 500us,100ms' would be a [500,100000] microseconds range. Note, too low values may cause failures or prevent the SUT from reaching deep C\-states. The optimal value is system\-specific.

.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\fR \fI\,EXCLUDE\/\fR
Datapoints to exclude: remove all the datapoints satisfying the expression 'EXCLUDE'. Here is an example of an expression: '(WakeLatency < 10000) | (PC6% < 1)'. This filter expression will remove all datapoints with 'WakeLatency'
smaller than 10000 nanoseconds or package C6 residency smaller than 1%. You can use any metrics in the expression.

.TP
\fB\-\-include\fR \fI\,INCLUDE\/\fR
Datapoints to include: remove all datapoints except for those satisfying the expression 'INCLUDE'. In other words, this option is the inverse of '\-\-exclude'. This means, '\-\-include expr' is the same as '\-\-exclude "not (expr)"'.

.TP
\fB\-\-keep\-filtered\fR
If the '\-\-exclude' / '\-\-include' options are used, then the datapoints not matching the selector or matching the filter are discarded. This is the default behavior which can be changed with this option. If '\-\-keep\-filtered' has been
specified, then all datapoints are saved in result. Here is an example. Suppose you want to collect 100000 datapoints where RTD is greater than 50 microseconds. In this case, you can use these options: \-c 100000 \-\-exclude="RTD > 50".
The result will contain 100000 datapoints, all of them will have RTD bigger than 50 microseconds. But what if you do not want to simply discard the other datapoints, because they are also interesting? Well, add the '\-\-keep\-filtered'
option. The result will contain, say, 150000 datapoints, 100000 of which will have RTD value greater than 50.

.TP
\fB\-\-report\fR
Generate an HTML report for collected results (same as calling 'report' command with default arguments).

.TP
\fB\-\-force\fR
By default a network card is not accepted as a measurement device if it is used by a Linux network interface and the interface is in an active state, such as "up". Use '\-\-force' to disable this safety mechanism. Use it with caution.

.SH COMMAND \fI\,'ndl report'\/\fR
usage: ndl report [\-h] [\-q] [\-d] [\-o OUTDIR] [\-\-exclude EXCLUDE] [\-\-include INCLUDE] [\-\-even\-up\-dp\-count] [\-x XAXES] [\-y YAXES] [\-\-hist HIST] [\-\-chist CHIST] [\-\-reportids REPORTIDS] [\-\-report\-descr REPORT_DESCR] [\-\-relocatable]

.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR, \fB\-\-outdir\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR
Path to the directory to store the report at. By default the report is stored in the 'ndl\-report\-<reportid>' sub\-directory of the test result directory. If there are multiple test results, the report is stored in the current directory.
The '<reportid>' is report ID of ndl test result.

.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\fR \fI\,EXCLUDE\/\fR
Datapoints to exclude: remove all the datapoints satisfying the expression 'EXCLUDE'. Here is an example of an expression: '(WakeLatency < 10000) | (PC6% < 1)'. This filter expression will remove all datapoints with 'WakeLatency'
smaller than 10000 nanoseconds or package C6 residency smaller than 1%. The detailed expression syntax can be found in the documentation for the 'eval()' function of Python 'pandas' module. You can use metrics in the expression, or the
special word 'index' for the row number (0\-based index) of a datapoint in the results. For example, expression 'index >= 10' will get rid of all datapoints except for the first 10 ones.

.TP
\fB\-\-include\fR \fI\,INCLUDE\/\fR
Datapoints to include: remove all datapoints except for those satisfying the expression 'INCLUDE'. In other words, this option is the inverse of '\-\-exclude'. This means, '\-\-include expr' is the same as '\-\-exclude "not (expr)"'.

.TP
\fB\-\-even\-up\-dp\-count\fR
Even up datapoints count before generating the report. This option is useful when generating a report for many test results (a diff). If the test results contain different count of datapoints (rows count in the CSV file), the resulting
histograms may look a little bit misleading. This option evens up datapoints count in the test results. It just finds the test result with the minimum count of datapoints and ignores the extra datapoints in the other test results.

.TP
\fB\-x\fR \fI\,XAXES\/\fR, \fB\-\-xaxes\fR \fI\,XAXES\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of metrics (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to use on X\-axes of the scatter plot(s), default is 'LDist'. Use '\-\-list\-metrics' to get the list of the available metrics. Use value 'none' to
disable scatter plots.

.TP
\fB\-y\fR \fI\,YAXES\/\fR, \fB\-\-yaxes\fR \fI\,YAXES\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of metrics (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to use on the Y\-axes for the scatter plot(s). If multiple metrics are specified for the X\- or Y\-axes, then the report will include multiple
scatter plots for all the X\- and Y\-axes combinations. The default is 'RTD'. Use '\-\-list\-metrics' to get the list of the available metrics. Use value 'none' to disable scatter plots.

.TP
\fB\-\-hist\fR \fI\,HIST\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of metrics (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to add a histogram for, default is 'RTD'. Use '\-\-list\-metrics' to get the list of the available metrics. Use value 'none' to disable histograms.

.TP
\fB\-\-chist\fR \fI\,CHIST\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of metrics (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to add a cumulative distribution for, default is 'RTD'. Use '\-\-list\-metrics' to get the list of the available metrics. Use value 'none' to
disable cumulative histograms.

.TP
\fB\-\-reportids\fR \fI\,REPORTIDS\/\fR
Every input raw result comes with a report ID. This report ID is basically a short name for the test result, and it used in the HTML report to refer to the test result. However, sometimes it is helpful to temporarily override the report
IDs just for the HTML report, and this is what the '\-\-reportids' option does. Please, specify a comma\-separated list of report IDs for every input raw test result. The first report ID will be used for the first raw rest result, the
second report ID will be used for the second raw test result, and so on. Please, refer to the '\-\-reportid' option description in the 'start' command for more information about the report ID.

.TP
\fB\-\-report\-descr\fR \fI\,REPORT_DESCR\/\fR
The report description \- any text describing this report as whole, or path to a file containing the overall report description. For example, if the report compares platform A and platform B, the description could be something like
'platform A vs B comparison'. This text will be included into the very beginning of the resulting HTML report.

.TP
\fB\-\-relocatable\fR
Generate a report which contains a copy of the raw test results. With this option, viewers of the report will also be able to browse raw statistics files which are copied across with the raw test results.

.TP
\fB\-\-list\-metrics\fR
Print the list of the available metrics and exit.
