1 Introduction
==============

*Wult* stands for "Wake Up Latency Tracer", and this is a project providing tools for measuring
C-state latency in Linux. The project provides 2 tools:

* *wult* - measures CPU C-state exit latency in Linux. This is the main deliverable of the project.
* *ndl* - measures the memory access latency observed by a PCIe network card when the CPU is is
  in a C-state. However, this tool is rarely used, and it is documented separately
  `here <pages/ndl.html>`_.

**Important note**: both *wult* and *ndl* are research, debugging and tracing tools which require
superuser privileges and must not be used in production environment.

2 Documentation
===============

These web pages are the primary source of *wult* and *ndl*. In addition to this, man pages include many
details:

* `Wult man page <https://github.com/intel/wult/blob/master/docs/wult-man.rst>`_.
* `Ndl man page <https://github.com/intel/wult/blob/master/docs/ndl-man.rst>`_.

Here is an `old wult presentation video recording <https://youtu.be/Opk92aQyvt0?t=8270>`_
by Artem Bityutskiy at Linux Plumbers Conference in 2019. The presentation begins at "2:17:50" and
it gives a high level *wult* introduction.

The presentation focuses on *wult* kernel drivers, but some of the details are out of date.

* The presentation is focused around the I210 NIC measurement method, but nowadays *wult* supports the
  *hrt* method, which is probably the main method you should use. This method does not require any
  special hardware, such as a NIC. We recommend using *hrt*.
* Nowadays we measure both wake latency (*WakeLatency*) and (*IntrLatency*). The latter is the time
  it takes to the CPU to exit the C-state and execute the interrupt handler.
