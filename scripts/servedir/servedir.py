"""
Serve a local directory on localhost.

Wult HTML reports can't be viewed locally due to restrictions imposed by web-browsers which prevent
them from reading report files. To solve this issue, the files must be hosted as a web-server.
Hence, this script was created so that it can be used to view wult HTML reports. Intended usage:
 1. Run this script.
 2. Select the report directory or a directory containing multiple reports when prompted to select
    one. Following this, the script opens the default browser at 'localhost:8000'.
